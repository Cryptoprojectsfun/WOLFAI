WOLFAI - AI-Powered Investment Platform
WOLFAI is an advanced investment platform that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide portfolio management, real-time market analysis, and automated trading signals.

Key Features
AI-Powered Market Analysis: LSTM neural networks process real-time market data to predict price movements and trends
Portfolio Optimization: Advanced algorithms optimize portfolio allocation based on risk tolerance and market conditions
Risk Management: Real-time monitoring of portfolio risk metrics with automated alerts
Real-Time Trading Signals: ML-based signals for entry and exit points
Automated Retraining: Self-improving models that adapt to changing market conditions
Technology Stack
Backend: Go (Golang)
Machine Learning: Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn
Database: PostgreSQL
Caching: Redis
API: RESTful with JWT authentication
Prerequisites
Go 1.21+
Python 3.9+
PostgreSQL 14+
Redis 6+
Make (optional, for using Makefile commands)
Quick Start
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Cryptoprojectsfun/WOLFAI.git
cd WOLFAI
Install Go dependencies:
go mod download
Install Python dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure environment:
cp config/app.example.yaml config/app.yaml
# Edit config/app.yaml with your settings
Setup databases:
# Start PostgreSQL and create database
createdb wolfai

# Run migrations
make migrate

# Start Redis server
redis-server
Start the server:
make run
The server will be available at http://localhost:8080

Architecture
Components
Market Data Pipeline: Real-time collection and processing of market data
ML Service: LSTM model training and inference
Portfolio Service: Portfolio management and optimization
Risk Service: Risk analysis and monitoring
API Layer: RESTful endpoints with authentication and rate limiting
Data Flow
Market data is collected in real-time through the data pipeline
Data is processed and stored in PostgreSQL/Redis
ML models analyze data to generate predictions
Portfolio and risk services use predictions to optimize allocations
Results are exposed through the API layer
API Documentation
Once the server is running, API documentation is available at:

Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/api/docs
OpenAPI JSON: http://localhost:8080/api/docs.json
Key endpoints:

/api/v1/auth/*: Authentication endpoints
/api/v1/portfolio/*: Portfolio management
/api/v1/analytics/*: Market analysis and predictions
/api/v1/risk/*: Risk metrics and alerts
Development
Run tests:

make test
Run linting:

make lint
Generate API documentation:

make docs
ML Model Training
Train new model:

python ml/train.py --config config/ml/lstm_config.json --output models/lstm
Model configs are in config/ml/:

lstm_config.json: LSTM model hyperparameters
training_config.json: Training parameters
Monitoring
The platform provides several monitoring endpoints:

/metrics: Prometheus metrics
/health: Health check status
/status: System status and version
